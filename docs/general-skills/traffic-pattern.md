## What is a pattern?

Otherwise referred to as ‘Traffic Pattern’ or ‘Circuit’ in other parts of the world, a pattern is an effective and common way to practice all stages of a flight. From takeoff to landing, a traffic pattern will help you strengthen your stills as a pilot.

    ### Direction of a Pattern

    Usually, the pattern will be to the left. Unless it is clearly communicated by airport markings or ATC (if applicable), the direction will be to the left.

    ### Altitude of a Pattern

    The altitude of a traffic pattern is usually 1000 feet above airport elevation. For example, if the elevation is 486 feet, the pattern altitude will be at 1486 feet. The pattern altitude may differ depending on the weight of the aircraft


    ### Speed when flying a Pattern

    When operating at a non-towered aerodrome, 200 knots is the speed limit. In any case, you should adjust your airspeed to maintain appropriate separation from other traffic

## Weather Considerations

As the PIC it is your responsibility to determine that weather conditions are safe for the airport you are conducting patterns at. Be sure to check local METARs and TAFs to make sure that you are in VMC and your aircraft’s crosswind limit is not exceeded (if applicable).

!!! warning

    Most mid-air collisions occur on clear days with unlimited visibility. Never assume you have all the traffic in sight. Always keep scanning for new or oncoming traffic.

!!! note "Traffic Levels"

    On VATSIM, people will often pick busier, larger airports to practice their patterns. This is because it is more likely that ATC will be online. As part of planning a traffic pattern, check a VATSIM map such as vatSpy to make sure traffic levels are low enough to conduct patterns

## Stages of a Pattern

Traffic patterns have five different legs/stages. These are defined as upwind/departure, crosswind, downwind, base and final.
