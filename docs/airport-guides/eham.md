## Introduction

Amsterdam is a large metropolis. With hundreds of planes landing and taking off every day, its vital to be familiar with the airport. EHAM is a rather complex airport, which can make it difficult for pilots to navigate. We hope this guide makes it easier and more enjoyable for you to flying into and out of this airport.

## Departures

### Taxiing

At EHAM, theres a parallel taxi route, taxiway ALPHA and BRAVO. These function like a normal road. Remain on the right side to follow the one way direction of the taxiway. In other words, taxiway ALPHA takes you clockwise around the airport, while taxiway BRAVO takes you counter-clockwise around the airport.

### Push Back

When pushing back, you also need to follow the direction of the taxiway. The nose of your plane should be pointing in the direction the taxiway runs.
