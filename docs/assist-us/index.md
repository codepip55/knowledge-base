The VSS Knowledgebase project aims to provide a set of high quality and easily accessible content to the flight simulation community.

This project is entirely open-source, relying on community contributions and support to help makes these the best they can be. You don't need to have an in-depth knowledge of programming languages to contribute to the project, as most of our pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){target=blank}. Everything else will be explained as we go.

## What are we looking for?

On VATSIM, we have to draw the line between what's hyper-realistic and the practical limitations of the network. People use VATSIM for a wide range of reasons - some seek a realistic service, whereas some people might just want to add an extra dimension to an already enjoyable hobby. When contributing to this project, it's important to keep this in mind and to cater to everybody on the network.

We draw the line at things like low-visibilty and noise-abatement operations - where there offer no real benefit in the virtual environment. In contrast, procedures for Code F aircraft *should* be added, as these can have an effect on Pilots and their aircraft.

## Before you dig in.
