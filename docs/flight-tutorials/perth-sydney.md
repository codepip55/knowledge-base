## Details

In this tutorial, we will guide you as you fly a Boeing 737-800, JST987, on an IFR flight from Perth to Sydney. You will remain in controlled airspace at all times. The flight time is approximately four hours.

!!! note "Flight Plan"
    - **Callsign:** JST987
    - **Radio Callsign:** Jetstart nine-eighty seven
    - **Aircraft Type:**  B738/L

Unline in some other parts of the world, in Australia, SIDs and STARs are issued by ATC and the pilot does not enter them when filing their flight plan.

## Requesting Clearance

Tune your radio up to Perth Delivery (PH_DEL) on 118.55. Once you have done this, you can request clearance as in the example below.

**[Pilot]** "Perth Delivery, Jetstar 987, to Sydney, request clearance"  
**[PH_DEL]** "Jetstar 987, stand-by."  

!!! note ""
    The correct response to the term "stand-by" is silence. You do not need to aknowledge an instruction to stand-by.

**[PH_DEL]** "Jetstar 987, cleared to Sydney via MUBID planned route, MUBID ONE departure, climb via SID 5000 feet, squawk 4235, departure frequency 123.6"  
**[Pilot]** "Cleared to Sydney via MUBID planned route, MUBID ONE departure, climb via SID 5000 feet, squawk 4235, departure frequency 123.6, Jetstar 987"  
**[PH_DEL]** "Jetstar 987"  

!!! note "Notes"
    **1)** The basic airways clearance covers the route described in the flight plan, and is referred to as 'flight planned route.' This is the only abbreviation permitted in any clearance an means *after conducting the MARUB ONE departure, you can expect to fly via the route you entered in your flight plan.*

    **2)** In the clearance you were told to *"climb via SID 5000,"* however your flight plan says you have planned FL350. The *"climb via sid"* altitude is what you will maintain after takeoff. It is important you do not exceed this clearance as there may be a traffic hazard. Also ensure you follow any altitude restrictions given by the SID.

    **3)** General acknowledgements are given by a trasmission of the aircraft callsign. In Australia, the phrase, "Readback correct" is not used, instead ATC confirms this by acknowledging your callsign.

## Pushback

Before pushback, ensure you have the current ATIS (listed below) as well as making sure you have your squawk code set correctly and any other pre-start items.

!!! tip ""
    **[ATIS YPPH M]**  
    PERTH TERMINAL INFORMATION MIKE  
    [APCH] EXP ILS APCH  
    [RWY] 21  
    [WIND] 160/6  
    [WX] CAVOK  
    [TMP] 25  
    [QNH] 1015  

Switch your radio to Perth Ground on 121.7 to request pushback from the gate. **Remember to squawk mode C so that ATC can track you on the ground and when airborne.**

**[Pilot]** "Perth Ground, Jetstar 987 is at Bay 152, request push and start"  
**[PH_GND]** "Jetstar 987, Perth Ground, push and start approved."  
**[Pilot]** "Push and start approved, Jetstar 987"  

Once you have completed pushback, call ground again to advise you are ready to taxi.

**[Pilot]** "Jetstar 987, with information MIKE, request taxi"  
**[PH_GND]** "Jetstar 987, taxi via BRAVO to holding point WHISKEY, runway 21"  
**[Pilot]** "Via BRAVO, holding point WHISKEY, runway 21, Jetstar 987"

Start taxi via the route provided by the ground controller, and remain on the current frequency.

## Takeoff

When you are at the holding point and ready for takeoff, tune to Perth Tower on 127.4 and call ready.

**[Pilot]** "Perth Tower, Jetstar 987, ready"  
**[PH_TWR]** "Jetstar 987, Perth Tower, hold short runway 21"  
**[Pilot]** "Hold short runway 21, Jetstar 987"

**[PH_TWR]** "Jetstar 987, runway 21, line up and wait"  
**[Pilot]** "Line up and wait runway 21, Jetstar 987"

**[PH_TWR]** "Jetstart 987, runway 21, cleared for takeoff"  
**[Pilot]** "Runway 21, cleared for takeoff, Jetstar 987"

Once airborne, tower will tell you to contact departures, you should then tune to the frequency you were provided in your clearance.

**[PH_TWR]** "Jetstar 987, contact departures"
**[Pilot]** "Contact departures, Jetstar 987"

!!! tip
    As you remember from when you received your clearance, you have received instructions on what to do. After takeoff, you need to track via the SID, climb to 5000 feet, and change to the departure frequency (as instructed). In this case we will be talking to Perth Approach, but since we are a departure, we can call them Perth Departures.

## Climb

Tune your radio to Perth Departures on the frequency given to you in your clearance (123.6).

**[Pilot]** "Perth Departures, Jetstar 987 passing 2500, climbing 5000"  
**[PH_DEP]** "Jetstar 987, Perth Departures, identified, climb via SID flight level 240"  
**[Pilot]** "Climb via SID flight level 240, Jetstar 987"

Adjust your autopilot to climb to 24,000FT. Make sure you are tracking via the SID.

!!! note "Identified"
    The transmission of the word "identified" means that ATC has identified you on their radar and verified your altitude is correct. In other countried they may say "radar contact."

**[PH_DEP]** "Jetstar 987, contact Melbourne Centre on 133.9"  
**[Pilot]** "133.9, Jetstar 987"

Tune your radio to 133.9 and call Melbourne Centre.

**[Pilot]** "Melbourne Centre, Jetstar 987 climbing flight level 240"  
**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987, Melbourne Centre, climb flight level 350"  
**[Pilot]** "Climb flight level 350, Jetstar 987"

!!! tip "Did You Know?"
    Did you know, you only need to report your level passing on first contact with the departure (or approach) controller or on first contact with the centre controller after becoming identified?

    In all other cases, simply state your assigned altitude. Examples:

    - "Melbourne Centre, QFA408, climbing to FL280"  
    - "Brisbane Centre G'day, VOZ617, descending to FL250"

## Cruise

During cruise, not much special happens. You may be told to deviate from your planned route temporarily or climb or descend to separate you from other planes. You may also be told to contact different centres along the way. Prior to TOD, ATC will contact you to give you your STAR clearance.

**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987, STAR clearance available"  
**[Pilot]** "Jetstar 987"  
**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987, cleared RIVET THREE arrival, runway 34L; when ready, descend flight level 240"

A STAR clearance contains 3 items in this order: your STAR or arrival procedure, the runway you can expect to land on, and your altitude instruction.

## Descent

In the STAR clearance you were told "when ready, descend flight level 240." This means that when you are ready, or when you reach your TOD, you may start descending to FL240. When you leave your maintained level, make sure to report to ATC.

**[Pilot]** "Jetstar 987, leaving flight level 350"  
**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987"

Once you have started descent, you will want to get the current ATIS for your arrival field.

!!! tip ""
    **[ATIS YSSY E]**  
    SYDEY TERMINAL INFORMATION ECHO  
    [APCH] EXP INDEPENDENT VISUAL APPROACH  
    [RWY] 16L AND 16R FOR ARRS AND DEPS  
    [OPR INFO] PARL RWY OPS IN PROG. INDEPENDENT ARRS AND DEPS IN PROG.  
    [WIND] 120/10G20  
    [WX] SCT 4500, BKN 5000  
    [TMP] 17  
    [QNH] 1014  
    ON FIRST CONTACT WITH SYDENY GROUND OR APPROACH, NOTIFY RECEIPT OF ECHO

Make sure you not only have the current ATIS, but are also familiar with your arrival. Ensure you know the waypoints and their speed or altitude restrictions.

**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987, descend 10,000, QNH 1014"  
**[Pilot]** "descend 10,000, QNH 1014, Jetstar 987"

**[ML_CTR]** "Jetstar 987, contact Sydney Approach 124.4"  
**[Pilot]** "Approach 124.4, Jetstar 987"

## Arrival

Tune to 124.4 as instructed.

**[Pilot]** "Sydney Approach, Jetstar 987 descending 10,000, with information ECHO"  
**[SY_APP]** "Jetstar 987, Sydney Approach, descend via STAR 6000, runway 16R, expect independent visual approach"  
**[Pilot]** "Descend via STAR 6000, runway 16R, Jetstar 987"

**[SY_APP]** "Jetstar 987, descend 3000, 24 track miles to run, report 16R in sight"  
**[Pilot]** "Descend 3000, wilco, Jetstar 987"

!!! note "Wilco and Track Miles"
    Wilco, meaning will comply, in this case means you will report when you have the runway in sight.

    ATC provides you with your "track miles to run." This is how many miles is left, including vectors, until you reach the runway threshold. ATC tells you this so that you can use an appropriate descent profile.

**[SY_APP]** "Jetstar 987, from NASHO, turn left heading 070"  
**[Pilot]** "From NASHO, left heading 070, Jetstar 987"

This approach ends in vectors and ATC has just instructed you that when you have crossed the waypoint NASHO, which is on your arrival route, you must turn left to heading 070. You do not need to report when you turn.

When you have the runway in sight:  
**[Pilot]** "Runway in sight, Jetstar 987"  
**[SY_APP]** "Jetstar 987, turn left heading 360 join final runway 16R, from that heading cleared independent visual approach; traffic ahead on the adjacent runway is a Boeing 737"  
**[Pilot]** "Turn left 360 join final 16R, cleared independent visual approach, copy traffic, Jetstar 987"

**[SY_APP]** "Jetstar 987, contact tower 120.5"  
**[Pilot]** "120.5, Jetstar 987"

## Landing

Tune to 120.5 as instructed.

**[Pilot]** "Sydney Tower, Jetstar 987"  
**[SY_TWR]** "Jetstar 987, Sydney Tower, runway 16R, cleared to land."  
**[Pilot]** "16R, cleared to land, Jetstar 987"  

## Taxi

Once you've landed and vacated the runway, report clear of the runway.

**[Pilot]** "Clear of 16R, Jetstar 987"  
**[SY_TWR]** "Jetstar 987, taxi BRAVO, cross runway 25, to the bay"  
**[Pilot]** "BRAVO, cross runway 25, to the bay, Jetstar 987"

You can now taxi to your desired parking bay. ATC has told you to cross runway 25, so you dont need to hold short of it. If you come across any other runway, you do need to hold short of it though.

Congratulations, you have completed your flight! It's always nice to thank ATC before you disconnect.
