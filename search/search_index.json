With hundreds of planes landing and taking off every day, its vital to be familiar with the airport. EHAM is a rather complex airport, which can make it difficult for pilots to navigate. We hope this guide makes it easier and more enjoyable for you to flying into and out of this airport. Departures Taxiing At EHAM , theres a parallel taxi route, taxiway ALPHA and BRAVO. These function like a normal road. Remain on the right side to follow the one way direction of the taxiway. In other words, taxiway ALPHA takes you clockwise around the airport, while taxiway BRAVO takes you counter-clockwise around the airport. Push Back When pushing back, you also need to follow the direction of the taxiway. The nose of your plane should be pointing in the direction the taxiway runs. SIDs Depending on your destination, you can expect to fly one of the following SIDs : BERGI for flights to the north-west. Exit points: BERGI, WISPA ANDIK for flights to the north-east. Exit points: ANDIK, BETUS, NOPSU, SPIJKERBOOR, TORGA ARNEM for flights to the east. Exit points: ARNEM, ELPAT, NYKER EDUPO for flihgts to the east. Exit points: EDUPO, IVLUT, LUNIX LOPIK for flights to the south-east. Exit points: LOPIK, OGINA, ROVEN WOODY for flights to the south. Exit points: WOODY, KUDAD, LARAS IDRID for flights to the west. Exit points: IDRID, VOLLA, VALKO, DENAG Flight Level Rules Unlike other parts of the world, EHAM makes use of your SID to determine your cruising flight level. You must have an EVEN flight level when assigned the BERGI or IDRID SID , and an ODD flight level when assigned any of the others. Below is a picture to demonstrate. Specific Flight Levels When flying to a particular destination, you may expect to fly one of the following levels: Flights to London airports: maximum FL240 Flight to (north)easter countries cannot use FL250 Flights to Paris airports: maximum FL290 Departure Procedures The transition altitude for IFR aircraft is 3000 ft, for VFR this is 3500 ft. The transition level is given in the ATIS . After departure, you will climb to a maximum FL060 until issued furthen climb by ATC . After departure, you switch from the Tower frequency to the Approach/Departure frequency after passing 2000 ft. You should always contact Approach/Departures yourself unless Tower specifically tells you to \"remain this frequency.\" Arrivals There are three IAFs at EHAM . Namely, SUGOL, ARTIP, and RIVER. When passing any of these IAFs , you are met with a speed restriction of 250 kts. You must also fly 160 kts until passing 4 DME . ILS Frequencies ILS runway 06 - 110.550 ILS runway 18C - 109.500 ILS runway 18R - 110.100 ILS runway 22 - 109.150 ILS runway 27 - 111.550 ILS runway 36C - 108.750 ILS runway 36R - 111.950 Just as when departing, when you arrive and have vacated the runway, you are expected to contact Ground yourself unless otherwise told.","title":"EHAM - Amsterdam Airport Schiphol"},{"location":"airport-guides/eham/#general-information","text":"ICAO: EHAM IATA: AMS Name: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol Location: Amsterdam, The Netherlands VATSIM : https://www.dutchvacc.nl/","title":"General Information"},{"location":"airport-guides/eham/#introduction","text":"Amsterdam is a large metropolis.

This page should give you an indication of how to properly set up an individual page or category. We'll go through the motions of setting up a new category, which will take you through most of the things needed. Starting a new Category or subdirectory Let's say we want to create a new 'Military' category, here's the category setup we'd want: Main Directory / docs/ military / .pages index.md buzzandbreak.md formationflying.md .pages Within the main docs/ directory, create the new folder. The name of the folder will also be what's shown in the URL string - in this case it'll be website.xyz/military/ . Within that directory, you can see a few files. The files ending in .md are singular pages and follow the normal page conventions. The .pages file is a MkDocs specific file that tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. We'll touch more on that later. Single Page Every page starts the same way - with a title declaration and an abbreviation include. --- title: Building Blocks --- --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" The title declaration block is sets the title across a few different areas. It automatically appears at the top of the page as an h1 element, and will show in all website navigation unless overwritten by a .pages file. The --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" line pulls in the abbreviations file. This pulls in defined abbreviations, and allows for these to be shown all across the site. Hint Since the title attribute can be seen across multiple areas, so it's important that it's both short and descriptive. If the page is nested within another category, you should be able to rely on context. For example, this page is called Building Blocks . This could mean Lego, but since it's in the Assist Us section, you would be fair to assume that it contains the building blocks of a page. .pages file As eluded to before, the .pages file is a tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. title: Military nav: - \"Overview\": index.md - \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - formationflying.md - ...

This doesn't change how the category is processed, only displayed. Breakdown: nav: - Dictates how items are shown, and in what order. This is mandatory. \"Overview\": index.md - \"Overview\" is a manually set title, and overrides any titles defined locally within the page itself. For the index.md page, this is shown as the index page for the directory it sits in. Once rendered, this page sits at website.xyz/military/ . \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - Same as above, but this file sits at website.xyz/military/buzzandbreak/ . formationflying.md - In this case, this file has a title defined within the file itself.

When your working on any content, we require you to create a new branch, that we can then merge into main . So how do we contribute a new item or section? Let's have a look! Fork the project into your personal account on GitHub. Create a new branch from main , with a clear name of what you're implementing - seen in the image on the right. Checkout your new branch, and commit some changes. Open a new Pull Request for your changes/branch. This can be done by heading to the knowledgebase repository, and finding Pull requests Make note of the arrow! In the image to the left, you can see that the arrow shows that we're wanting to merge this-is-a-test-branch into main . After making sure the arrows are correct, click on the green Create pull request button. Make sure your title clearly explains the changes you've made, but is still concise. Fill out the main content of your PR as necessary. The main content of your PR serves as the project tracker for that feature or fix. Feel free to add in checkboxes of important steps, or whatever you need. Other people are also able to make changes to your branch, and may occasionally have some discussion on your PR.

Guides for skills such as flying a traffic pattern, or flying from A to B in the most effecient way possible.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"general-skills/straight-and-level/","text":"Adapted from FAA-H-8083-3B Chapter 3 Introduction Airplanes operate in a different environment than a car, bike or just by walking. Drivers and bikers tend to focus on the forward motion and new pilots tend to do the same. However, an airplane operates in a 3-dimentional (3D) environment. Pilots need to be aware of horizontal, vertical, and lateral movement. Straight-and-level flight are one of four fundamentals when flying an airplane. The Four Fundamentals The four fundamentals of flight are: straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents. Flight Controls An airplane flies in a 3D environment, meaning, it can travel up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. The forward movement of the elevator control will always move the plane in the same direction relative to the pilot's perspective. If the plane is right side up relative to the horrizon, pushing forward on the elevator control will cause the plane to descend. On the other hand, if the plane is upside down relevant to the horrizon, the same action will cause the plane to climb. Depending on the airplane's orientation to the earth, the same control actions can result in different reactions. That's why we came up will the following rule: Important The pilot is always considered the referenced center of effect as the flight controls are used. The following is always true regardless of the orientation to earth: With the pilot's hands: Pulling the elevator pitch control toward the pilot (otherwise called back pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to rotate backwards around the pitch (lateral) axis of the airplane. Pushing the evelator pitch control away from the pilot (otherwise called forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to rotate forwards around the pitch axis of the airplane. Rotating the aileron control to the right will cause the airplane's right wing to bank (roll) lower. Rotating the aileron control to the left will cause the airplane's left wing to bank lower. With the pilots' feet: Pushing the right rudder pedal away from the pilot (forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to move (yaw) to the right . Pushing the left rudder pedal away from the pilot (forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to yaw to the left . Attitude Flying An airplane's attitude is determined by the angular difference between an airplane's axis and the natural horizon. A false horrizon can occur when the natural horizon is concealed or not apparent. This is important because it required the pilot to create a pictorial sense of the natural horizon. Note Pitch Attitude: The angle formed between the airplane's lpngitudinal axis and the natural horizon. (A) Bank Attitude: The angle formed by the airplane's lateral axis and the natural horizon. (B) Yaw Attitude: The angle formed by the airplane's vertical axis and the direction or flight; not relative to the natural horizon. (A) Pitch attitude is the angle formed between the airplane\u2019s longitudinal axis. (B) Bank attitude is the angle formed by the airplane\u2019s lateral axis. Controlling an airplane requires one of two methods to determine the airplane's attitude in reference to the horizon. Flying in VMC When flying in VMC , a pilot uses their eyes and visually references the aircraft's wings and cowling to determine the airplane's attitude to the horizon. Flying in IMC When flying in IMC , the natural horizon is obscured and thus a pilot cannot visually reference it. That's why, in IMC , the pilot uses the airplane's machanical or electronic instruments to determine the airplane's attitude to the natural horizon. Controlling an Airplane's Attitude Airplane attitude control is composed of four components: Pitch Control: Using the elevator to raise and lower the airplane's nose. Bank Control: Using the ailerons to reach a desired bank angle. Power Control: Using the throttle to control the thrust and airspeed to meet a specific objective. Trim Control: Used to relieve the control pressures held by the pilot on the flight controls after a desired pitch attitude has been attained. Straight-and-Level Flight Straight-and-Level Flight, What is it? Straight-and-Level Flight is flight in which heading and altitude are constantly maintained. The Four Fundamentals are in essence a spin of straight-and-level flight. Therefore, the importance of this concept can not be understated. Straight-and-level flight is essentially a matter of fixing the relationship of a reference point on the aircraft to the natural horizon. Since the refernce points depend on the pilot's seating position, height, and the way they sit, it's important that your reference points are established on the ground. Tip Vertical reference lines are best establsihed on the ground, such as when the aircraft is placed on the centerline of a runway. Horizontal reference lines are best establsihed during flight, such as during cruise. The horizon reference point will always remain the same, since that point is always on the horizon. Straight Flight Maintining a constant direction or heading is accomplished by keeping both wings level. Both wingtips should be equal above or below the natural horizon. Any correction should be made with coordinated use of the ailerons and rudder. Wingtip reference for straight-and-level flight. Straight-and-level flight does not require application of flight controls if the air is smooth and the aircraft is properly trimmed. If corrections are necessary, the pilot may make the correction precisely, smoothly, and accurately. Warning Pilots may tend to look out to one side continually, generally to the left due to the pilot\u2019s left seat position and consequently focus attention in that direction. This not only gives a restricted angle from which the pilot is to observe but also causes the pilot to exert unconscious pressure on the flight controls in that direction. It is important to continually scan around you to ensure the aircraft's attitude is correct, but also to ensure other factors are on par for a safe flight. Continually checking bot wingtips has multiple advantages: it's the only positive check for level flight, it allows you to look for traffic, terrain, significant weather, and maintaining situational awareness. Level Flight Maintaining level flight is a fairly simple skill. In learning this, it's important that the pilot should only exert enough pressure on the flight controls to produce the desired result. The pilot should learn to associate movements of references with control pressures which produce attitude movement. Subsequently, the pilot can develop an ability to adjust the airplane's attitude without having to excessively rely on instruments or outside references. During straight-and-level flight, the airspeed should remain the same if the power setting is also constant. Maintaining Level Flight Level flight involves having the pilot properly seated, selecting a reference point infront of you, and then keeping that reference point in a fixed position relative to the natural horizon. A common error new pilots make is attempting to hold the wings level by only referencing the aircraft's nose. Due to the nose's short horizontal reference line, slight deviations could go unnoticed. As such, the wingtips should be the primary reference when maintaining straight-and-level flight.","title":"Straight-and-Level Flight"},{"location":"general-skills/straight-and-level/#introduction","text":"Airplanes operate in a different environment than a car, bike or just by walking.

That's why we came up will the following rule: Important The pilot is always considered the referenced center of effect as the flight controls are used. The following is always true regardless of the orientation to earth: With the pilot's hands: Pulling the elevator pitch control toward the pilot (otherwise called back pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to rotate backwards around the pitch (lateral) axis of the airplane. Pushing the evelator pitch control away from the pilot (otherwise called forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to rotate forwards around the pitch axis of the airplane. Rotating the aileron control to the right will cause the airplane's right wing to bank (roll) lower. Rotating the aileron control to the left will cause the airplane's left wing to bank lower. With the pilots' feet: Pushing the right rudder pedal away from the pilot (forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to move (yaw) to the right . Pushing the left rudder pedal away from the pilot (forward pressure) will cause the airplane's nose to yaw to the left .","title":"Flight Controls"},{"location":"general-skills/straight-and-level/#attitude-flying","text":"An airplane's attitude is determined by the angular difference between an airplane's axis and the natural horizon.

Straight-and-Level Flight is flight in which heading and altitude are constantly maintained. The Four Fundamentals are in essence a spin of straight-and-level flight. Therefore, the importance of this concept can not be understated. Straight-and-level flight is essentially a matter of fixing the relationship of a reference point on the aircraft to the natural horizon. Since the refernce points depend on the pilot's seating position, height, and the way they sit, it's important that your reference points are established on the ground. Tip Vertical reference lines are best establsihed on the ground, such as when the aircraft is placed on the centerline of a runway. Horizontal reference lines are best establsihed during flight, such as during cruise. The horizon reference point will always remain the same, since that point is always on the horizon.","title":"Straight-and-Level Flight"},{"location":"general-skills/straight-and-level/#straight-flight","text":"Maintining a constant direction or heading is accomplished by keeping both wings level. Both wingtips should be equal above or below the natural horizon. Any correction should be made with coordinated use of the ailerons and rudder. Wingtip reference for straight-and-level flight. Straight-and-level flight does not require application of flight controls if the air is smooth and the aircraft is properly trimmed. If corrections are necessary, the pilot may make the correction precisely, smoothly, and accurately. Warning Pilots may tend to look out to one side continually, generally to the left due to the pilot\u2019s left seat position and consequently focus attention in that direction. This not only gives a restricted angle from which the pilot is to observe but also causes the pilot to exert unconscious pressure on the flight controls in that direction. It is important to continually scan around you to ensure the aircraft's attitude is correct, but also to ensure other factors are on par for a safe flight. Continually checking bot wingtips has multiple advantages: it's the only positive check for level flight, it allows you to look for traffic, terrain, significant weather, and maintaining situational awareness.","title":"Straight Flight"},{"location":"general-skills/straight-and-level/#level-flight","text":"Maintaining level flight is a fairly simple skill. In learning this, it's important that the pilot should only exert enough pressure on the flight controls to produce the desired result. The pilot should learn to associate movements of references with control pressures which produce attitude movement. Subsequently, the pilot can develop an ability to adjust the airplane's attitude without having to excessively rely on instruments or outside references. During straight-and-level flight, the airspeed should remain the same if the power setting is also constant. Maintaining Level Flight Level flight involves having the pilot properly seated, selecting a reference point infront of you, and then keeping that reference point in a fixed position relative to the natural horizon. A common error new pilots make is attempting to hold the wings level by only referencing the aircraft's nose. Due to the nose's short horizontal reference line, slight deviations could go unnoticed. As such, the wingtips should be the primary reference when maintaining straight-and-level flight.","title":"Level Flight"},{"location":"general-skills/traffic-pattern/","text":"Adapted from FAA-H-8083-3B Chapter 7 What is a pattern? Otherwise referred to as \u2018Traffic Pattern\u2019 or \u2018Circuit\u2019 in other parts of the world, a pattern is an effective and common way to practice all stages of a flight. From takeoff to landing, a traffic pattern will help you strengthen your stills as a pilot. Direction of a Pattern Usually, the pattern will be to the left. Unless it is clearly communicated by airport markings or ATC (if applicable), the direction will be to the left. Altitude of a Pattern The altitude of a traffic pattern is usually 1000 feet above airport elevation. For example, if the elevation is 486 feet, the pattern altitude will be at 1486 feet. The pattern altitude may differ depending on the weight of the aircraft Speed when flying a Pattern When operating at a non-towered aerodrome, 200 knots is the speed limit. In any case, you should adjust your airspeed to maintain appropriate separation from other traffic Weather Considerations As the PIC it is your responsibility to determine that weather conditions are safe for the airport you are conducting patterns at. Be sure to check local METARs and TAFs to make sure that you are in VMC and your aircraft\u2019s crosswind limit is not exceeded (if applicable). Warning Most mid-air collisions occur on clear days with unlimited visibility. Never assume you have all the traffic in sight. Always keep scanning for new or oncoming traffic. Traffic Levels On VATSIM , people will often pick busier, larger airports to practice their patterns. This is because it is more likely that ATC will be online. As part of planning a traffic pattern, check a VATSIM map such as vatSpy to make sure traffic levels are low enough to conduct patterns Stages of a Pattern Traffic patterns have five different legs/stages. These are defined as upwind/departure, crosswind, downwind, base and final. Stages Upwind Leg The upwind leg is flown at controlled airports and after go-arounds. When necessary, the upwind leg is part of the traffic pattern in which the aircraft goes from final approach to the climb altitude to initiate a go-around. When at a safe altitude, the pilot will make a shallow bank turn to the upwind side of the airport; this allows for better visibility of the runway for departing aircraft. Departure Leg The departure leg is starts when the aircraft leaves the ground and ends when the pilot commences a 90\u00b0 turn to the crosswind leg. The departure leg is flown straight after takeoff, starting from when the aircraft leaves the ground until the pilot commences a 90\u00b0 turn to the crosswind leg. On the departure leg, the pilot should continue a steady climb. If remaining in the pattern, when within 300 feet of the pattern altitude, commence a turn to the crosswind leg of the pattern. If departing the pattern, the pilot will continue straight or make a 45\u00b0 turn to the left of right (depending on the pattern direction) after reaching the pattern altitude. Crosswind Leg The crosswind leg is horizontally perpendicular to the extended centerline of the active runway. The crosswind leg is horizontally perpendicular to the extended centerline of the takeoff runway. The pilot enters a crosswind leg by making a 90\u00b0 turn from the upwind leg. The pilot should continue on the crosswind leg to the downwind leg position. Since the takeoff was most likely made into the wind, the wind will now be approximately perpendicular to the aircraft. The pilot may make slight turns into the wind to remain on a ground track that is horizontally perpendicular to the extended centerline of the runway. Downwind Leg The downwind leg is a leg parallel but in the opposite direction of the active runway. The downwind leg is flown parallel but in a opposite direction to the active runway. The leg is flown at about \u00bd to 1 mile out from the landing runway. During the leg, pilots should complete all pre-landing checks, including deploying landing gear if applicable. Pattern altitude is maintained until at least the approach end of the landing runway. The pilot should continue the downwind leg until a point about 45\u00b0 from the approach end of the runway. Then the pilot, will make a medium bank turn to the base leg of the pattern. Base Leg The base leg is a transitional leg from downwind to the final approach leg. The base leg is opposite the crosswind leg and is the transitional leg from downwind to final. The pilot should pay close attention to the wind to make sure there is sufficient distance from the approach end. This ensures a calm, gradual descent to the touchdown point. The ground track of the aircraft is perpendicular to the extended centerline of the landing runway. As with the crosswind leg, the pilot may make adjustments to the head of the aircraft so as to not drift from the intended flight path. Before turning onto final, the pilot must ensure there is no danger of colliding with another aircraft already on final approach. Do not attempt a steep turn onto the final approach leg. Remember: If in doubt, go around. Final Leg The final leg is a leg along the extended centerline of the runway with a descending flightpath to touchdown. Otherwise referred to as \u201cfinal,\u201d the final approach leg starts on the completion of the base-to-final turn and ends when the aircraft has touched down. Often referred to as the most important part of the pattern, the final approach leg requires careful precision and sound judgement from the pilot to accurately control airspeed and descent angle. When on final approach, you have the right-of-way over other aircraft. When multiple aircraft are on final, the aircraft with the lowest altitude has the right-of way. (14 CFR Part 91) Entering the Pattern When arriving, the pilot should be aware of circuit direction, altitude and traffic, among others. Additionally, the pilot should remain clear of other traffic until established on the entry leg. The entry leg is often flown at a 45\u00b0 angle to the downwind leg, heading towards a point abeam the midpoint of the landing runway. Descending while entering the pattern creates a serious collision hazard. The pilot should ensure the length of the entry leg is sufficient to provide a clear view of the entire pattern and to allow for adequate planning for the arrival. Alternative Methods of Entry You can also enter the pattern by overflying the field first. When overflying the airfield, it is best to stay at about 500 feet above the pattern altitude. If large turbine aircraft operate at your airfield, fly at a pattern altitude of 2000 feet above ground level to ensure separation from them.

An imporperly trimmed aircraft requires constant flight control pressure which causes tension and fatigue, is distracts the pilot from visual scans, and contributes to erratic attitude control inputs. What is it for? Trim control surfaces are used to take away any constant flight control pressure inputs provided by the pilot. For example, elevator trim is typical in light GA aircraft and is used to remove the workload from the pilot. If the pilot wanted to pitch down, they could adjust the elevator trim instead of having to use forwards pressure on the pitch flight control. This allows the pilot to focus on other tasks, such as scanning for traffic and maintaining situational awareness. How do I Use it? Most large airplanes come equiped with rudder, elevator, and airleron trim while smaller GA aircraft are only equiped with elevator trim. When multiple trim axes are available, they should be applied in this order: Rudder first, then elevator, and lastly aileron trim. If airspeed is varying, continuous trimming of the rudder and aileron produces unnecessary workload and distraction. Attemps to trim the rudder at differentiating airspeeds is impractical because many propeller planes have built-in compensation for the effect of a propeller's left turning tendencies. The correct procedure in applying trim is as follows; when the pilot has established constant airspeed and pitch attitude, the pilot should hold the wings level with the aileron flight control pressure while rudder control pressure is trimmed out. Finally, aileron trim should then be adjusted to relieve any aileron flight control pressure. A properly trimmed airplane demonstrates good piloting skills. Any control forces felt by the pilot should be a result of deliberate and coordinate flight control pressure inputs. Common Error A common trim control error is the tendency to overcontrol the airplane with trim adjustments. Attempting to fly the airplane using trim control is a common error among even experienced pilots.
